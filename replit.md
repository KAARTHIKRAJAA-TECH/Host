# Content Shield - Blockchain-Based Copyright Prevention Social Media Platform

## Project Overview
Content Shield is a sophisticated social media platform that leverages simulated blockchain technology to revolutionize content ownership, licensing, and copyright protection. The platform enables content creators to maintain control over their digital assets while providing a secure environment for content sharing and licensing.

## Problem Statement

### Industry Challenge
- **Digital Content Piracy**: Creators lose billions annually due to unauthorized use of their content
- **Lack of Ownership Proof**: Difficulty in proving original ownership of digital content
- **Complex Licensing Process**: Traditional licensing systems are slow and bureaucratic
- **No Creator Control**: Existing platforms don't give creators enough control over their content distribution
- **Attribution Issues**: Content gets shared without proper attribution to original creators

### Our Solution
Content Shield addresses these challenges by:
- Implementing blockchain-inspired content verification and ownership tracking
- Providing granular licensing controls (free, paid, permission-based, none)
- Creating an immutable record of content creation and ownership
- Enabling direct creator-to-consumer licensing without intermediaries
- Offering robust admin controls for platform governance

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation Questions

**Q: Why did you choose this tech stack?**
A: I selected a modern, industry-standard stack that prioritizes developer experience and maintainability. React with TypeScript provides excellent type safety and developer tooling. Express.js offers flexibility for API development. SQLite eliminates deployment complexity while Drizzle ORM ensures type-safe database operations. This combination allows rapid development while maintaining code quality.

**Q: How do you handle authentication and security?**
A: I implemented session-based authentication using Passport.js with bcrypt for password hashing. Sessions are stored in SQLite for persistence. The system includes role-based access control, CORS protection, and input validation using Zod schemas. All API endpoints have proper authentication middleware.

**Q: Explain the licensing system architecture.**
A: The licensing system uses a request-approval workflow. When users want access to content, they create a license request. Content owners can approve or reject these requests. The system tracks license status, user access permissions, and maintains an audit trail. This enables granular control over content distribution.

**Q: How do you ensure data integrity?**
A: I use foreign key constraints, cascading deletes, and transaction-based operations. Content hashes verify file integrity. The ORM provides type safety at compile time. All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas before database operations.

### Architecture & Design Questions

**Q: How would you scale this application?**
A: For scaling, I would migrate to PostgreSQL with connection pooling, implement Redis for session storage and caching, add a CDN for file delivery, containerize with Docker, and implement horizontal scaling with load balancers. The current architecture supports these migrations without major refactoring.

**Q: What challenges did you face during development?**
A: The main challenge was database compatibility when migrating from PostgreSQL to SQLite. I had to handle data type differences, especially with Date objects that SQLite doesn't natively support. I resolved this by converting dates to ISO strings before storage.

**Q: How do you handle file uploads and storage?**
A: I use Multer middleware for multipart file handling with configurable storage destinations. Files are stored with unique names to prevent conflicts. The system generates thumbnails for images and maintains file metadata in the database. For production, this could be migrated to cloud storage like AWS S3.

### Problem-Solving Questions

**Q: How does the blockchain aspect work?**
A: While not using actual blockchain, I implemented blockchain-inspired features like content hashing for integrity verification, immutable records of content creation, and a transparent licensing transaction system. Content hashes serve as digital fingerprints to prove authenticity and detect tampering.

**Q: What's your approach to testing this application?**
A: I would implement unit tests for utility functions, integration tests for API endpoints, component testing for React components, and end-to-end testing for critical user flows. The type-safe architecture with TypeScript and Zod validation reduces many potential runtime errors.
